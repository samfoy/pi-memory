# pi-memory

Persistent memory for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Learns corrections, preferences, and project patterns from sessions and injects them into future conversations.

## Features

- **Automatic learning** — Extracts preferences, project patterns, and corrections from conversations at session end via LLM consolidation
- **Context injection** — Automatically adds relevant memory into every new session's system prompt
- **Corrections stick** — Mistakes you correct once become permanent lessons (e.g. "use sed for daily notes, not echo >>")
- **Complements session-search** — session-search finds *what you did*, pi-memory remembers *what you learned*

## Install

**Recommended:** Install [pi-total-recall](https://github.com/samfoy/pi-total-recall) to get the complete context stack — persistent memory, session history search, and local knowledge search in one package:

```bash
pi install pi-total-recall
```

Or install pi-memory standalone:

```bash
pi install npm:@samfp/pi-memory
```

Or add to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": ["npm:@samfp/pi-memory"]
}
```

> **Note:** Make sure you use the `@samfp/` scope. There is an unrelated `pi-memory` package on npm that will install instead if you omit the scope.

## Memory Types

| Type | Key prefix | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Preferences | `pref.*` | `pref.commit_style` → "conventional commits" |
| Project patterns | `project.*` | `project.rosie.di` → "Dagger dependency injection" |
| Tool preferences | `tool.*` | `tool.sed` → "use for daily note insertion" |
| User identity | `user.*` | `user.timezone` → "US/Pacific" |
| Lessons | *(table)* | "DON'T: use echo >> for vault notes, use sed" |

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_search` | Search semantic memory by keyword |
| `memory_remember` | Manually store a fact or lesson |
| `memory_forget` | Delete a fact or lesson |
| `memory_lessons` | List learned corrections |
| `memory_stats` | Show memory statistics |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/memory-consolidate` | Manually trigger memory extraction from current session |

## How It Works

1. **`session_start`** — Opens the SQLite store, shows memory stats briefly in the status bar, and injects a `<memory>` context block as a hidden custom message (customType `pi-memory-context`, `display: false`) **before** any user message. One-shot per session.
2. **`agent_end`** — Collects conversation messages for later consolidation
3. **`session_shutdown`** — Runs LLM consolidation (via `pi -p --print`) to extract structured knowledge, then closes the store

### Consolidation

At session end, if there were ≥3 user messages, the extension sends the conversation to an LLM and asks it to extract:

- **Preferences** — coding style, workflow habits, tool choices
- **Project patterns** — languages, frameworks, architecture decisions
- **Corrections** — things you corrected, mistakes to avoid

Only facts with confidence ≥ 0.8 are stored. Lessons are deduplicated using exact match and Jaccard similarity (≥ 0.7 threshold).

### Injection

At session start, stored memory is organized into sections (preferences, project context scoped to cwd, tool preferences, lessons, user identity) and injected **once** as a hidden `<memory>` custom message that sits before the first user message in history. The block is capped at 8KB.

The injection happens at `session_start` via `pi.sendMessage`, not per-turn. This is deliberate:

- **Correctness.** A per-turn injection via `before_agent_start` places the memory block *after* the user's question in the message list, so the model ends up responding to the memory block instead of the user. One-shot at the top of history avoids that ordering trap.
- **Cache stability.** Mutating the system prompt per turn (as earlier versions did) invalidates the provider's prefix cache after the system block (Bedrock / Anthropic `cache_control`), forcing the conversation suffix to be re-written at `cacheWrite` rates on every turn boundary.
- **Simplicity.** One block, one time, cached for the whole session.

Tradeoff: per-user-message selective injection is off by default — the fallback dump covers preferences, project context for the cwd, tool preferences, lessons, and user identity, which is enough for typical workflows given the 8KB cap. Users with large memory stores who want per-query relevance can opt in (see "Per-turn injection" below).

### Per-turn injection (opt-in)

Set `perTurnInjection: true` to restore v1.0.x per-turn behavior:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "perTurnInjection": true
  }
}
```

When enabled:

- The session_start fallback dump is skipped.
- Each user turn runs a semantic search against the current prompt, and the result is appended to the system prompt (not sent as a custom message — that would place it after the user's question in history).
- Pro: facts outside the 8KB fallback dump reach the model when they match the current prompt.
- Con: the system prompt mutates per turn, invalidating the provider's prefix cache after the system block (Bedrock / Anthropic `cache_control`). The conversation suffix gets re-cached at `cacheWrite` rates on every user-turn boundary (~12.5x `cacheRead` on Claude).

Correctness is preserved either way: `systemPrompt` is a separate field from the messages list, so the user's question remains the last user-role message.

**Lesson filtering in per-turn mode** — When `perTurnInjection: true`, the `lessonInjection` config takes effect:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "perTurnInjection": true,
    "lessonInjection": "selective"
  }
}
```

In `selective` lesson mode, lessons are filtered by:

1. **Prompt relevance** — FTS search against the user's first message
2. **Project context** — lessons matching the current working directory's project
3. **Category inference** — keywords in the prompt trigger relevant categories (e.g. "pentest" pulls in `bug-bounty` lessons, "blog post" pulls in `writing` lessons)
4. **General lessons** — always included regardless of prompt

The result is capped at 15 most relevant lessons instead of all of them.

| `lessonInjection` | Behavior (only when `perTurnInjection: true`) |
|------|----------|
| `"all"` (default) | All lessons injected every turn |
| `"selective"` | Only relevant lessons based on prompt, project, and category |

**Consolidation model** — At session end, pi-memory spawns a lightweight `pi -p --print` process to extract facts and lessons from the conversation. By default it uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, which is a no-op for users on non-Anthropic providers. Override it with any model string your `pi` binary accepts:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "lessonInjection": "selective",
    "consolidationModel": "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
  }
}
```

Set this in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` for a user-wide default, or in `{project}/.pi/settings.json` (either under `memory` or `pi-memory`) to override per project. Examples: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`, `ollama/qwen3:8b`, `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. If the model string is invalid the consolidation sub-process fails silently and the session's memory is simply not consolidated — no data is lost from previous sessions.

## Storage

SQLite database at `~/.pi/memory/memory.db` (WAL mode). Three tables:

- `semantic` — key-value facts with confidence scores
- `lessons` — learned corrections with dedup
- `events` — audit log of all memory operations

### Project-local storage

To keep a project's memory isolated from your user-global memory, add one of the following to `{project}/.pi/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  // Package-specific — wins over the cascade below.
  "pi-memory": {
    "localPath": ".pi/memory"   // resolves to {project}/.pi/memory/memory.db
  }
}
```

Or, if installed via [`pi-total-recall`](https://github.com/samfoy/pi-total-recall), a single cascade key covers all three bundled packages:

```jsonc
{
  "pi-total-recall": {
    "localPath": ".pi/total-recall"
    // pi-memory             → {project}/.pi/total-recall/memory/memory.db
    // pi-session-search     → {project}/.pi/total-recall/session-search/
    // pi-knowledge-search   → {project}/.pi/total-recall/knowledge-search/
  }
}
```

**Resolution order (highest priority first):**

1. `pi-memory.localPath` in `{cwd}/.pi/settings.json`
2. `pi-total-recall.localPath` cascade → `{localPath}/memory/memory.db`
3. Global default: `~/.pi/memory/memory.db`

Existing global installs are unaffected — this is strictly additive.
